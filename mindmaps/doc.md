        WASM Build Setup (Emscripten, whisper.cpp to WASM, TS Bindings) [21, 116-125]
          How compilation is done: Emscripten compiles C++ to .wasm and JS wrapper [125, 126]
          Why compile: Browsers can't run C++ directly; enables high-performance native code [125, 126]
        Model Management System (IndexedDB caching, Progress, Hugging Face CDN) [21, 116, 118, 121, 123, 127-130]
          IndexedDB for large binary file storage (models) [116, 130, 131]
          Versioning: Tagged models, update new versions [130, 131]
          Quota Management: Tracks usage, warns near limits, allows deletion [130, 131]
          CORS Fix for Model Download: Proxy server route `/api/models/download/:modelName` [132, 133]
        Browser Whisper Engine (WASM integration, Audio Preprocessing, Real-time/Batch) [21, 121, 123, 128, 134]
          SharedArrayBuffer Polyfill: Fallback for unsupported browsers [135]

          Integration with correct Fastify API routes based on method selected [143, 147]
          Ensure backend Whisper API calls use correct host (e.g., `localhost:3002`) [148]
          Multipart form fields parsing for Zod validation [149, 150]
          Correct Python CLI arguments for `openai-whisper` [151, 152]
          Auth token sent in fetch headers [153]
        Add Model Download UI Component [127, 141, 142]

        Error Handling UI Components (Error boundary, specialized error messages) [158]

      Phase 3: Server-Side Integration (Native Whisper.cpp) (✅ COMPLETE)
        Native Whisper.cpp Setup (Install, Docker container, Model storage, Health checks, CPU/GPU optimization) [124-126, 157, 159, 160]
          Why Docker: Consistent, reproducible environments, better performance for large files [125, 126]
          Health Checks: Automated checks for server and Whisper service [125, 126]
          Non-fatal initialization: Server starts even if Docker fails [161]
