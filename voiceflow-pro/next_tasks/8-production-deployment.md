# Task 8: Production Deployment and Scaling

## Input
- API and web app codebase
- Docker and CI/CD configuration

## Output
- Dockerized API and web app
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deploys
- Production Supabase config
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Guidelines
- Create Dockerfiles for API and web
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Configure Supabase for production
- Add monitoring/logging (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)
- Optimize performance and caching

## Functional Tests Validation
- [ ] Build and run Docker containers locally
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs on push/PR
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitoring/logging captures errors and metrics
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Rollback works if deploy fails

## Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test Docker build and run scripts
- Test CI/CD workflow logic
- Test monitoring/logging integration
- Test performance/caching logic
