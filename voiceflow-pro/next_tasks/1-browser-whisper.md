# Task 1: Implement Real Browser Whisper Processing

## Input
- whisper.cpp source code
- Emscripten build environment
- UI for file upload and real-time transcription

## Output
- WebAssembly build of whisper.cpp
- Model download and caching (tiny, base, small)
- WebWorker for background processing
- UI integration for browser-based transcription

## Guidelines
- Use Emscripten to compile whisper.cpp to WASM
- Implement progressive model download with IndexedDB caching
- Use a WebWorker for all WASM processing
- Replace mock browser whisper with real inference
- Optimize memory usage for large files
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Functional Tests Validation
- [ ] Upload audio file and receive accurate transcription in browser (mock: 10s mp3)
- [ ] Model download progress bar works (simulate slow network)
- [ ] IndexedDB model cache persists after reload
- [ ] WebWorker does not block UI (simulate 100MB file)
- [ ] Transcription matches OpenAI API for same file (Â±10%)
- [ ] Fallback to error message if browser not supported

## Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test WASM module loads and returns expected output for known audio
- Test model download, cache, and integrity check logic
- Test WebWorker message passing and error handling
- Test UI state transitions for upload, progress, and result
