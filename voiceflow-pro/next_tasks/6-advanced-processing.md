# Task 6: Implement Advanced Processing Features

## Input
- Transcript segments
- Audio files

## Output
- Speaker detection and labeling
- Auto-punctuation and capitalization
- Noise reduction and audio enhancement

## Guidelines
- Integrate speaker diarization (use open-source or cloud API)
- Add AI-powered punctuation and formatting
- Implement noise reduction pre-processing
- UI: show speakers, confidence, and enhanced text

## Functional Tests Validation
- [ ] Speaker labels appear in transcript (mock: 2-speaker audio)
- [ ] Punctuation/capitalization correct in output
- [ ] Noise reduction improves transcription accuracy (mock: noisy audio)
- [ ] UI displays enhanced transcript and speaker colors
- [ ] Error shown if processing fails

## Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test diarization logic with mock segments
- Test punctuation/capitalization on sample text
- Test noise reduction on sample audio
- Test UI for speaker display and enhanced text
