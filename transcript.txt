Mac Whisper. You helped me to extract the different features that Mac Whisper application offers

and we go together


Speaker 1 0:00:53 - 0:00:56

. Now, set up the specifications


Speaker 1 0:01:04 - 0:01:17

for the implementation of user interfaces for all the features. We will define the requirements, the organization of the screens


Speaker 1 0:01:24 - 0:01:32

, the sequence of screens, the positioning of the buttons, the menus and the features, the organization of all


Speaker 1 0:01:44 - 0:01:50
