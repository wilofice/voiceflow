# Task 12: Performance and Security Optimization

## Input
- Web and API codebase
- Security and performance requirements

## Output
- WebGPU acceleration for browser Whisper
- Audio streaming optimization
- Security audit and hardening
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- GDPR compliance features

## Guidelines
- Integrate WebGPU for browser Whisper if available
- Optimize audio streaming for speed and reliability
- Conduct security audit and fix vulnerabilities
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Add GDPR/CCPA compliance features

## Functional Tests Validation
- [ ] WebGPU acceleration works in supported browsers
- [ ] Audio streaming is fast and reliable (mock: 100MB file)
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical issues
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks abusive requests
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance checklist complete
- [ ] Error shown if security/compliance fails

## Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test WebGPU detection and fallback
- Test streaming logic with large files
- Test rate limiting and abuse scenarios
- Test GDPR/CCPA compliance logic
