Analyzed MacWhisper app details and prepared to assist.
3s




I can see you've shared information about MacWhisper, a transcription app for Mac that uses OpenAI's Whisper technology. It looks like a comprehensive audio-to-text solution with both free and Pro versions.

The app seems quite feature-rich - it can transcribe audio files locally on your device, supports over 100 languages, offers various export formats (including subtitles), and the Pro version includes advanced features like automatic speaker recognition, batch transcription, and integrations with AI services like ChatGPT and Claude.

Is there something specific you'd like to know about MacWhisper, or would you like help with anything related to transcription or audio processing? I'm happy to discuss the features, help you understand the differences between the free and Pro versions, or assist with any other questions you might have.


You are the product designer, the product manager . Imagine you are asked to build a competition to MacWhisper.  Your boss asked you to build a better version of MacWhisper, a sellable, more likable that would beat MacWhisper selling advantage.

├── Web App (Next.js 14 + React 18)
├── Desktop App (Tauri v2 - Rust + Web)
├── Shared Component Library (Storybook)
└── Design System (Tailwind + Radix UI)
Why This Stack:

Next.js 14: App Router, Server Components, built-in optimization
Tauri over Electron: 90% smaller bundle, better performance, Rust security
TypeScript: Mandatory for team velocity and bug prevention
Tailwind + Radix: Rapid UI development, accessibility built-in
Real-time Features:

typescript
// WebSocket + React Query for real-time collaboration
const useRealtimeTranscript = (transcriptId: string) => {
  const socket = useWebSocket(`/ws/transcript/${transcriptId}`)
  const { data, mutate } = useSWR(`/api/transcripts/${transcriptId}`)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('transcript_update', (delta) => {
      mutate(data => applyDelta(data, delta), false)
    })
  }, [socket, mutate])
}
Backend Architecture
Primary Stack: Node.js + Fastify + TypeScript

├── API Gateway (Fastify + tRPC)
├── Auth Service (Supabase Auth)
├── Transcription Service (Bull Queue + Redis)
├── AI Processing Service (Separate Node.js process)
├── File Storage (Supabase Storage + CloudFlare R2)
├── Real-time Service (Socket.io)
└── Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)
Why Node.js over Python/Go:

Team Velocity: Shared TypeScript across stack
Ecosystem: Rich audio processing libraries (ffmpeg-wasm, web-audio-api)
Real-time: Native WebSocket support, event-driven architecture
AI Integration: Excellent OpenAI SDK, streaming support
API Architecture Pattern:

typescript
// tRPC for type-safe API calls
export const transcriptRouter = t.router({
  create: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({ audioFile: z.string(), language: z.string() }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      const job = await transcriptionQueue.add('transcribe', input)
      return { jobId: job.id, status: 'queued' }
    }),
  
  stream: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({ transcriptId: z.string() }))
    .subscription(async function* ({ input }) {
      // Real-time transcription streaming
      yield* transcriptionStream(input.transcriptId)
    })
})
Database Architecture
PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM

sql
-- Core schema design
CREATE TABLE transcripts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT,
  duration INTEGER,
  language VARCHAR(5),
  status transcript_status,
  audio_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE transcript_segments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transcript_id UUID REFERENCES transcripts(id),
  start_time DECIMAL,
  end_time DECIMAL,
  text TEXT,
  speaker_id INTEGER,
  confidence DECIMAL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Collaboration features
CREATE TABLE transcript_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transcript_id UUID REFERENCES transcripts(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  segment_id UUID REFERENCES transcript_segments(id),
  content TEXT,
  timestamp_position DECIMAL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
Why PostgreSQL:

JSON Support: Store AI metadata, user preferences
Full-text Search: Built-in transcript search
ACID Transactions: Critical for collaborative editing
Scalability: Proven at scale, excellent hosting options
Audio Processing Pipeline
Multi-Stage Processing Architecture:

typescript
// Audio processing pipeline
class AudioProcessor {
  async processAudioFile(file: File): Promise<ProcessedAudio> {
    // Stage 1: Format normalization
    const normalized = await this.normalizeAudio(file)
    
    // Stage 2: Enhancement (noise reduction, leveling)
    const enhanced = await this.enhanceAudio(normalized)
    
    // Stage 3: Chunking for streaming transcription
    const chunks = await this.createChunks(enhanced, 30) // 30-second chunks
    
    return { enhanced, chunks, metadata: this.extractMetadata(file) }
  }
}
Audio Stack:

bash
# Client-side (Browser)
- Web Audio API (real-time processing)
- MediaRecorder API (recording)
- ffmpeg-wasm (format conversion)

# Server-side
- ffmpeg (audio processing)
- whisper.cpp (local transcription fallback)
- OpenAI Whisper API (primary transcription)
AI Integration Architecture
Hybrid AI Processing:

typescript
// Multi-provider AI system
class AIOrchestrator {
  async transcribe(audio: AudioChunk): Promise<TranscriptSegment> {
    // Primary: OpenAI Whisper API
    try {
      return await this.openAITranscribe(audio)
    } catch (error) {
      // Fallback: Local Whisper.cpp
      return await this.localTranscribe(audio)
    }
  }
  
  async enhanceTranscript(segments: TranscriptSegment[]): Promise<EnhancedTranscript> {
    // Parallel processing for speed
    const [
      punctuated,
      actionItems,
      summary,
      keyQuotes
    ] = await Promise.all([
      this.addPunctuation(segments),
      this.extractActionItems(segments),
      this.generateSummary(segments),
      this.extractKeyQuotes(segments)
    ])
    
    return { punctuated, actionItems, summary, keyQuotes }
  }
}
AI Provider Strategy:

Primary: OpenAI (Whisper + GPT-4o-mini for post-processing)
Fallback: Local Whisper.cpp for privacy/offline
Future: Anthropic Claude for advanced reasoning

Performance & Scalability
Real-time Performance Targets
typescript
// Performance requirements
const PERFORMANCE_TARGETS = {
  transcription: {
    latency: '< 2 seconds from audio end',
    throughput: '10x realtime (10min audio in 1min)',
    accuracy: '> 95% for clear English audio'
  },
  collaboration: {
    sync_latency: '< 100ms for text updates',
    concurrent_users: '50 users per transcript',
    offline_support: 'Local changes synced on reconnect'
  },
  file_processing: {
    upload_speed: '> 10MB/s average',
    format_support: '15+ audio/video formats',
    max_file_size: '2GB (4 hours of audio)'
  }
}
Caching Strategy
typescript
// Multi-layer caching
class CacheManager {
  // Level 1: Browser cache (transcripts, audio waveforms)
  browserCache = new Map<string, CachedTranscript>()
  
  // Level 2: Redis cache (API responses, user sessions)
  redisCache = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL)
  
  // Level 3: CDN cache (static assets, processed audio)
  cdnCache = cloudflareR2
  
  async getCachedTranscript(id: string): Promise<Transcript | null> {
    // Check browser -> Redis -> Database
    return await this.browserCache.get(id) || 
           await this.redisCache.get(`transcript:${id}`) ||
           await this.database.findTranscript(id)
  }
}
Security & Privacy
Data Protection Architecture
typescript
// Privacy-first design
class PrivacyManager {
  // Audio files encrypted at rest
  async storeAudioFile(file: ArrayBuffer, userId: string): Promise<string> {
    const encrypted = await this.encryptFile(file, userId)
    const url = await this.supabase.storage.upload(`${userId}/audio/${uuid()}`, encrypted)
    return url
  }
  
  // Automatic data deletion
  async scheduleCleanup(transcriptId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Delete source audio after 30 days (configurable)
    await this.scheduler.schedule('cleanup-audio', { transcriptId }, { delay: '30d' })
  }
}
Security Measures:

Encryption: AES-256 for files, bcrypt for passwords
Authentication: JWT tokens, rate limiting, 2FA support
Privacy: GDPR compliance, data retention policies
Audit: All actions logged, no PII in logs
Technical Risks & Mitigation
High-Risk Areas
1. Real-time Transcription Latency

typescript
// Risk: WebRTC + Whisper API latency > 5 seconds
// Mitigation: Chunked processing + optimistic updates

class StreamingTranscriber {
  async processRealTimeAudio(stream: MediaStream): Promise<void> {
    const chunks = this.createOverlappingChunks(stream, 10) // 10s chunks, 2s overlap
    
    chunks.forEach(async (chunk, index) => {
      // Process chunks in parallel
      const transcript = await this.transcribe(chunk)
      
      // Optimistic UI update
      this.ui.updateTranscript(transcript, index, 'pending')
      
      // Confirm with next chunk overlap
      if (index > 0) {
        this.ui.confirmTranscript(index - 1)
      }
    })
  }
}
2. OpenAI API Cost Explosion

typescript
// Risk: $1000+/month API costs with growth
// Mitigation: Smart caching + local fallback

const costOptimizer = {
  // Cache common phrases/segments
  transcriptCache: new LRUCache<string, string>(10000),
  
  // Use local Whisper for long files
  shouldUseLocal: (duration: number) => duration > 3600, // 1 hour
  
  // Batch processing for efficiency
  batchTranscribe: async (audioChunks: AudioChunk[]) => {
    return await Promise.all(audioChunks.map(this.transcribe))
  }
}
3. Collaboration Sync Conflicts

typescript
// Risk: Multiple users editing same transcript segment
// Mitigation: Operational Transformation (OT)

class CollaborativeEditor {
  applyOperation(op: TextOperation, transcript: Transcript): Transcript {
    // Transform operation against concurrent operations
    const transformedOp = this.operationalTransform.transform(op, this.pendingOps)
    
    // Apply and broadcast
    const newTranscript = this.applyTextOperation(transcript, transformedOp)
    this.broadcast('transcript_update', { op: transformedOp, transcript: newTranscript })
    
    return newTranscript
  }
}
